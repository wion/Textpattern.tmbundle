# Textpattern.tmbundle

Textpattern.tmbundle is a TextMate 2 language bundle for [Textpattern CMS](https://textpattern.com), notably for its [theme templating](https://docs.textpattern.com/build/themes-creating-using-and-sharing) language (txp, for lack of a proper name) based on Textpattern's exstensive suite of core [Tags](https://docs.textpatter.com/tags/). Theme package template files have .txp extension (in addition to the accompanying .css and .json files).

# History

This bundle was [originally created by Marios Butner in 2007](https://web.archive.org/web/20070627014758/http://www.consking.com/article/txp-bundle-version-07) for TextMate 1. It mostly functions in TextMate 2, but needs modernizing against changes made in both TextMate and Textpattern.

@wion has resurfaced the bundle, with Butner's permission (who is currently not on GitHub), as a viable tool option for those who use Textpattern and wish to develop Textpattern theme packages in TextMate. Butner has said he does not support the bundle anymore, so as far as this repository's owner is concerned, this bundle is in the care of the "Textpattern project":https://github.com/textpattern, for which is was created; while recognizing that Butner may like to be the repo maintainer, whether by his own account or under that of Txp on GitHub.

# Objectives

Immediate objectives are to test the bundle as it exists and start getting [Issues](https://github.com/wion/textpattern.tmbundle/issues) written for fixing/changing things to make the bundle better for developing Textpattern themes.

# Installation

The textpattern.tmbundle must be installed in the /Bundles directory at:

```
~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
```

If you donâ€™t want the bundle under version control, then download the bundle zip, unpack it, and move that into the directory. Then change as you like.

Alternatively, if you want the bundle reflecting the latest changes made here, clone this repository to:

```
~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/textpattern.tmbundles
```

Likewise, you can always fork off!
