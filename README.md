# Textpattern.tmbundle

Textpattern.tmbundle is a TextMate 2 language bundle for [Textpattern CMS](https://textpattern.com), notably for its [theme templating](https://docs.textpattern.com/build/themes-creating-using-and-sharing) language (called 'txp', for lack of a proper name) based on Textpattern's exstensive suite of core [Tags](https://docs.textpatter.com/tags/). Theme package template files have a .txp extension (in addition to the accompanying .css and .json files).

# History

This bundle was originally created by [4Blubot](https://github.com/4Blubot) in [2007](https://web.archive.org/web/20070627014758/http://www.consking.com/article/txp-bundle-version-07) for TextMate 1. It mostly functions in TextMate 2, but needs modernizing against changes made in both TextMate and Textpattern.

Wion has resurfaced the bundle, with 4Blubot's permission, as a viable tool option for those who use Textpattern and wish to develop Textpattern theme packages in TextMate. 4Blubot has expressed disinterest in supporting the bundle for the time being, but an allowance is made in the event that might change.

So as far as this repository's owner is concerned, the bundle is in the care of the Textpattern project, for which is was created, while recognizing that 4blubot may like to be the repo maintainer in the future, whether on own account or under that of the [Textpattern project on GitHub](https://github.com/textpattern).

# Objectives

Immediate objectives are to test the bundle as it exists and start getting [Issues](https://github.com/wion/textpattern.tmbundle/issues) written for fixing/changing things to make the bundle better for developing Textpattern themes.

# Installation

For the textpattern.tmbundle to work in your TextMate installation, the bundle must be added to the /Bundles directory at:

```
~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
```

That is all. Open TextMate and find the **Textpattern** bundle available under the Bundles menu, in the bundles editor list, and in the bundle selector options at bottom of window chrome.

**Clone, fork, or zip?**

Download the bundle zip package if you want to use the bundle independently of version control (or want to use something other than GitHub).

Fork this repository if you want independence _and_ GitHub version control.

Clone this repository if you are happy with the collective changes collaborators make here.
