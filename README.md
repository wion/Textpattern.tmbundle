# Textpattern.tmbundle

Textpattern.tmbundle is a TextMate 2 language bundle for [Textpattern CMS](https://textpattern.com), notably for its [theme templating](https://docs.textpattern.com/build/themes-creating-using-and-sharing) language (txp, for lack of a proper name) based on Textpattern's exstensive suite of core [Tags](https://docs.textpatter.com/tags/). Theme package template files have .txp extension (in addition to the accompanying .css and .json files).

# History

This bundle was [originally created by Marios Butner in 2007](https://web.archive.org/web/20070627014758/http://www.consking.com/article/txp-bundle-version-07) for TextMate 1. It mostly functions in TextMate 2, but needs modernizing against changes made in both TextMate and Textpattern.

Wion has resurfaced the bundle, with Butner's permission (who is currently not on GitHub), as a viable tool option for those who use Textpattern and wish to develop Textpattern theme packages in TextMate. Butner has said he does not support the bundle anymore, but an allowance is made that he might change his mind. So as far as this repository's owner is concerned, the bundle is in the care of the Textpattern project, for which is was created, while recognizing that Butner may like to be the repo maintainer in the future, whether by his own account or under that of the [Textpattern project on GitHub](https://github.com/textpattern).

# Objectives

Immediate objectives are to test the bundle as it exists and start getting [Issues](https://github.com/wion/textpattern.tmbundle/issues) written for fixing/changing things to make the bundle better for developing Textpattern themes.

# Installation

For the textpattern.tmbundle to work in your TextMate installation, the bundle must be added to the /Bundles directory at:

```
~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
```

That is all. Open TextMate and find the **Textpattern** bundle available under the Bundles menu, in the bundles editor list, and in the bundle selector options at bottom of window chrome.

**Clone, fork, or zip?**

Download the bundle zip package if you want to use the bundle independently of version control (or want to use something other than GitHub).

Fork this repository if you want independence _and_ GitHub version control.

Clone this repository if you are happy with the collective changes collaborators make here.
